## Introduction

Test-Driven Development (TDD) is a software development methodology where tests are written before code implementation. While effective, traditional TDD is time-consuming and requires deep problem domain knowledge. With advancements in AI, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), integrating AI into TDD presents new opportunities to enhance development efficiency and automate test creation.

AI-driven TDD introduces questions such as how it compares to traditional TDD, potential risks, and whether AI-generated tests can maintain reliability. Prior studies have explored AI in automated testing, but this research focuses on using Prompt Engineering to structure AI-driven TDD, particularly for developers with 0-3 years of experience.

## Focus Area

This study examines how AI and Prompt Engineering can enhance TDD for inexperienced developers. By developing a structured approach, we analyze its advantages, limitations, and risks while comparing AI-driven TDD to manual TDD. The goal is to identify best practices for AI integration in software development.

## Motive and Value

This research aims to promote a test-driven approach in academic and professional settings. AI-driven TDD could enhance efficiency, reduce development time, and simplify learning for developers and students by streamlining test creation.
